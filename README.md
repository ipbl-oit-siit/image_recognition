# image_recognition
- You have to do all the following `learning tasks`.

<!-- - There are `challenge` tasks in `Image processing advanced` section.
    - We strongly recommend all students read the documents on all `challenge` tasks because there would be many hints or important information helping you done the final tasks.
    - If you have time to spare,  please try to complete `challenge` tasks.  -->

- The following [Sample programs](#sample-programs) will help you develop more advanced image processing programs. Work with your team members to try out the samples.

# Learning tasks
- [Image processing basics for static image](image_processing/basics_image.md)
- [Image processing basics for video (webcam)](image_processing/basics_video.md)
- [Image processing advanced](image_processing/advanced.md)
- Image recognition
